                        of Education.  It's goal is to prepare children for kindergarten.  We use a series of assessments
                        that will drive individual instruction for each child. The children will be given an assessment during
                        the first two weeks.  This will assess the child's level in math, oral language, print knowledge, and phonological
                        awareness.  This allows teachers to focus on individual needs of the child.`, 
        how: `We work on foundational learning skills such as fine motor skills, letter recognition, sound recognition,
                and communication.  We do this through fun and engaging curricullum such as; The Beyond Centers, Circle Time, 
                and The Creative Curriculum. This veriety of learning experiences enhances retention of information and creates a
